## Developer Guide for Jackscript:

#### Functions I need to get rid of :
- isSubset()
- isSuperset()

#### Functions I need to create:
A relation is a subset of a cartesian product C x D. is called a a relation from C to D.
- relation()... meaning a relation could be anything... could be many thinds...
  I can instead have a function that tests relation..
- IsRelation(from C , to D)
  Note that an empty set can also be a relation. A relation can only have 2 elems(a,b)
